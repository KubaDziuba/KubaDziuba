Hi, I’m Jakub Dziuba and I am on my way to become programmer.
I want to switch career, because I believe, that if I will be realizing my hobby at work, then I wouldn't be working at all.
Why I will be good at it? Aside from quick ability to learn and analytical mind, there is one more thing.

Every person has a thing, which they love to do for hours, even so they hate it at the moments.
For me that thing is cracking code.
Put me in front of a computer screen and let me code... I won't leave until I finished writing whatever feature I was in the middle of.
Issue to solve on the way? Even better, because I know, that when I will be looking for solution, I will learn 10 other things, before finding what I was looking for.

Until now I have written one WPF app in C#. I tried to follow MVVM patern. When I took a look at this app after gaining some knowledge, I realized, that it had nothing to do with MVVM:
- no real models
- program logic in ViewModels
- SQL statements written manualy, beacuse I haven't used ORM
- tons of redundant code.

But it worked...

Now I have switched into web development with Django as my framework of choice.
Fingers crossed I will achieve my goal one day, which is to make a living out of writing code.
